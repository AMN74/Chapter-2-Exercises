#Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the following formula:
#Distance = Speed * Time
#A car is traveling at 90Km/h (Kilometers per hour). Write a program that displays the following:
#• The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
#• The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
#• The distance the car will travel in 15 hours
#• The distance the car will travel in 2 hours and 25 minutes

# It should convert to metrics and than display Km driven, liters used and L per 100Km.
